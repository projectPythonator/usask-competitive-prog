# Programming Contest Cheat Sheet (python 3)
---
## Description
###### This Repository is a collection of Alogrithm implementations seen frequently in both competitve programming contests and interviews. We use python to take advantage of pythons ability to produce short code implementations at the cost of a constant factor at runtime. We are trying to implement the shortest code that still has a reasonable runtime. Most of the code is writen in a way that translating it to c, java, or c++ should be reasonably easy this and lots of the code comes from c/c++ implmemtations
